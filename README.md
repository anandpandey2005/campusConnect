# Campus Connect

## Overview

Campus Connect is a full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between students and universities through a seamless, secure, and scalable digital platform.  
This is my first publicly accessible full-stack project, built with a clean and modular architecture ensuring high maintainability and industry-ready code practices.

## Project Vision

The goal of Campus Connect is to create a unified ecosystem where students, administrators, and universities can connect effortlessly — enabling profile management, authentication, document uploads, and efficient admin supervision.
